Add URL Slugs to `&lt;body&gt;` Class


== Description ==

This plug-in takes the URL, chops it into pieces, and adds each "piece" as an additional
class to the `&lt;body&gt;` tag.

Meaning, if your page's URL is:
http://aarontgrogg.com/2012/02/24/wordpress-plugin-add-url-slugs-as-body-classes/
Your page's `&lt;body&gt;` tag would have at least these classes:
`2012 02 24 wordpress-plugin-add-url-slugs-as-body-classess`

It gets much stronger when you start thinking about Categories or nested Pages:
`http://aarontgrogg.com/category/wordpress/`
which would give you:
`category wordpress`
while:
`http://aarontgrogg.com/movies/star-trek/wrath-of-khan/`
would give you:
`movies star-trek wrath-of-khan`

Please let me know if you have any questions/suggestions/thoughts,
